<h1 align = center >QUIZ GAME</h1>

<p>This project implements a True or False Quiz Game using Python. The game presents a series of true/false questions to the player, who must select the correct answer. The program keeps track of the player's score and provides immediate feedback on each response. The quiz questions can be stored in a list, dictionary, or external file, and the game can be enhanced by integrating an API for dynamic question generation. </p>
